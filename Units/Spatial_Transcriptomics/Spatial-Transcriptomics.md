# General information
Spatial Transcriptomics is an advanced method that enables the visualization and quantitative analysis of the transcriptome within individual tissue sections. By placing histological sections on glass slides embedded with arrayed oligonucleotides carrying positional barcodes, this technology generates high-quality cDNA libraries with precise spatial information for RNA sequencing. The resulting data provides a comprehensive transcriptomic landscape that integrates gene expression with tissue architecture, offering significant value for research and diagnostics.  

As the first method to deliver unbiased whole-transcriptome analysis with spatial resolution from tissue sections, Spatial Transcriptomics opens new possibilities for bioinformatics analyses in understanding tissue-specific gene expression.  

The National Genomics Infrastructure (NGI) offers Spatial Transcriptomics as a service in collaboration with the Single Cell and Spatial Biology platform, of which NGI has been an integral part since 2021.
