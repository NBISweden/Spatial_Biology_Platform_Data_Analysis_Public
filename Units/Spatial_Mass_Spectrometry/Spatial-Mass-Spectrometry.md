# General information  
Spatial mass spectrometry is a cutting-edge, label-free technique for visualizing and quantitatively analyzing the distribution of chemical species, either targeted or untargeted, directly within tissue sections. Utilizing state-of-the-art mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) technologies, including matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) and desorption electrospray ionization (DESI), this method delivers exceptional speed, sensitivity, and molecular specificity. These capabilities enable the simultaneous imaging of hundreds to thousands of molecules per pixel. The Spatial Mass Spectrometry unit offers specialized services for imaging drugs, their metabolites, and endogenous biomolecules—such as neurotransmitters, lipids, glycans, peptides, and small proteins—within tissue sections, achieving near-cellular lateral resolution.  

# Next Steps  
- Improvement of the workflow implemented and used in [this paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-023-01937-y).
